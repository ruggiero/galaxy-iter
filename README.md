## About

This code uses the algorithm found in Radionov, Athanassoula & Sotnikova
(2009) for generating the initial conditions for a galaxy simulation
with the code GADGET-2, including live gaseous/stellar disk, halo and
bulge components.

To use it, you need to compile 4 different modified versions of GADGET-2
and put them in the galaxy/ folder, with the names gadget_0, gadget_1,
gadget_2 and gadget_3. They respectively only allow gas particles,
dark matter particles, disk particles and bulge particles to move.
I manually updated GADGET-2 for that.  Additionally, gadget_0 must be
compiled with the -DISOTHERMAL flag.

This code is highly experimental, and I don't use it anymore for three
reasons: it takes a long time to generate the initial conditions; it
has an unidentified bug which makes halo and bulge particles accumulate
around the z axis once the galaxy is simulated; and I have another code
that just worksâ„¢, which is available in the [galstep](https://github.com/ruggiero/galstep) repository.
